To Do  
--modify 290B computers to repeated try to connect to space registry if it fails. Allows for the possibility that a computer would try to start before the space.  
--make hw_manager run on boot/reboot of hw_manager AMI  
--Should space rebind use a random or different service name so multiple spaces can run?  
--Should space bind to dns name specifically in code? or just with -D in script?  
--Do computer's need to bind to their exterior amazon dns names?  
--Why is RMI so reliant on DNS? This is dumb.
